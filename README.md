# Imdat Celeste

Hi there, 

I'm Imdat Celeste. I work on various private projects but also on some interesting public ones.

I will keep adding stuff here, but for now: You can always find me on Fedi as <a rel="me" href="https://tau-ceti.space/@ics">@ics@tau-ceti.space</a>.

I am also a non-voting <a rel="me" href="https://anarres.family/@admin">Member of the Anarres Family</a>.

Currently, I am working on Ginlo II and Netfiles NG. If this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry. You are not alone. We are still work-in-progress there.

Also, I am responsible for some of the IT topics at <a href="https://foodhub-muenchen.de/">FoodHub MÃ¼nchen</a>. Specifically, I am also the <a rel="me" href="https://foodhub-muenchen.social/@admin">Admin FoodHub MÃ¼nchen Social.</a>

Nice to be acquinted with you.
